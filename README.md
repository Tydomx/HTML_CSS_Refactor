Refactored HTML and CSS to make Horiseon website more accessible and compact


## Refactoring for Accessibility 
Application is a website for Horiseon which increases optimization for the user with management and marketing. Refactored the website so that it would have easier accessibility in the code to be more readable such as drying out the css, so that makes the code less repetitive on parts .
